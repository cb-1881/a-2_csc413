MySQL Server Not Running: Make sure that the MySQL server is running on the host and port you're trying to connect to.

Incorrect Connection Details: Verify that the hostname, port, database name, username, and password in your connection URL are correct. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306. Make sure you're using the right port if your setup is different.

Network Issues: Ensure there are no network issues preventing your application from reaching the MySQL server. If you're running the server on a different machine, check that firewalls or network policies are not blocking connections on the MySQL port.

MySQL Server Configuration: The MySQL server might be configured to not accept connections from your application's host. Check the MySQL server's bind-address configuration in the my.cnf or my.ini file. If it's set to 127.0.0.1 or localhost, it will only accept connections from the local machine. To accept connections from other hosts, change it to 0.0.0.0 or the specific IP address of your server, and restart the MySQL service.
